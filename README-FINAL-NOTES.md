# eAteliers - Home Task

## *Description of the project*

The landing page created displays the images obtained through the provided API. These images are under a components which can be viewed by clicking on the forward or backward buttons.

Clicking on a specific image will display it in a new tab.

### *Features:*
Several features were added during the process, such as a button for the user to directly access the dress collection.

Animations were added to the top bar. When the mouse hovers over any of the icons, they perform an animation.

Clicking the "Buy" button on the dress cards automatically changes their status.


### *Unmet objectives:*
- It was not possible to establish logic so that when the "Buy" button is clicked, a number would be displayed in the cart icon.
- Not achieved the possibility to view the dress image without having to pen another window.
